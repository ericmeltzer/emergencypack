<p style="clear:both; padding-top:10px;">I am an entrepreneur working on making well-designed physical objects at <a href="http://hellotoc.com">TOC</a>, the first of which is a map of San Francisco. Before I withdrew from school last year to start TOC, I was a sophomore at Peking University in Beijing, where I studied Biology. On the right is my wonderful wife and frequent collaborator (when she isn't busy in lab), Shan. 

<p>I like climbing (mostly at Mission Cliffs), eating at Z&Y, and bargaining in places where it isn't normally acceptable.
