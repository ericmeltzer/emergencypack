  <h2 id='the_problem'>The Problem</h2>

<p>Communities forced to rely on aid from outside organizations are left extremely vulnerable during natural disasters. Since making an earthquake kit or a hurricane bag remains perpetually on many family’s “to-do” list, a ready-made off-the-shelf option is valuable, but the emergency kits currently on the market are extremely disappointing. They contain a lot of useless cruft (dinky band-aids, anti-itch cream) and they fail to include many things which are key in a real disaster (ex: duct tape, hemostatic bandages, fasteners, water purification and storage equipment).</p>

<h2 id='the_solution'>The Solution</h2>

<p>Ready-to-go custom made backpacks filled with the most useful equipment for disaster response (as chosen by medical professionals, first responders, and disaster survivalists) and <em>absolutely nothing else</em>. The first run of packs will be funded by 1000 pre-orders and will be sold at-cost. Subsequent runs will be sold normally at a low price-point, both to individual and institutional customers. Packs will also be available to purchase as donations, which will be distributed to those in need by our partner NGOs.</p>

Greg&#8217;s recent experience as an instructor in combat medicine procedures for Deployment Medicine International has allowed him to provide priceless advice on what items to include in the medical portion of the pack, and how to best instruct people in their use.</p>

<p>Steven has an MD from UCSF, and has had experience conducting medical relief operations in the developing world. He presently serves as the EHR Ambulatory Physician Director for Sutter Health. His many years of practice as well as his familiarity with wilderness medicine techniques are proving useful in refining the medical portion of the pack.</p>

<p>Calli is a designer and artist in San Francisco, CA, with a great deal of experience designing clothes and accessories of all kinds.

<p><img src='images/justin.jpg' alt='Justin Photo' /> <strong>Justin Jach</strong> - Videographer</p>

<p>Justin is a videographer who makes mainly documentary style work in which music plays a big part. He speaks English, Spanish, and Portuguese, and has just returned from a documentary trip to the Middle East where he documented the nascent hacker-space movement in Lebanon. He will be shooting the video that will form the centerpeice of the crowdfunding campaign.</p>

<p><img src='images/eric.jpg' alt='Greg Photo' /> <strong>Eric Meltzer</strong> - Project Lead</p>

<p>Eric Meltzer is the founder of The Open Company, a small startup dedicated to making well-designed high quality goods and selling them at reasonable prices.
