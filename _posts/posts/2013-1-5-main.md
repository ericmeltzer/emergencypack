##The Problem
Communities forced to rely on aid from outside organizations are left extremely vulnerable during natural disasters. Since making an earthquake kit or a hurricane bag remains perpetually on many family’s “to-do” list, a ready-made off-the-shelf option is valuable, but the emergency kits currently on the market are extremely disappointing. They contain a lot of useless cruft (dinky band-aids, anti-itch cream) and they fail to include many things which are key in a real disaster (ex: duct tape, hemostatic bandages, fasteners, water purification and storage equipment).


##The Solution
Ready-to-go custom made backpacks filled with the most useful equipment for disaster response (as chosen by medical professionals, first responders, and disaster survivalists) and *absolutely nothing else*. The first run of packs will be funded by 1000 pre-orders and will be sold at-cost. Subsequent runs will be sold normally at a low price-point, both to individual and institutional customers. Packs will also be available to purchase as donations, which will be distributed to those in need by our partner NGOs.
