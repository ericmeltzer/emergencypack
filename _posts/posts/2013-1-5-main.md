##THE PROBLEM
Communities forced to rely on aid from outside organizations are left extremely vulnerable during natural disasters. Since putting together an earthquake kit or a hurricane bag remains perpetually on many family’s “to-do” list, a ready-made off-the-shelf option is valuable, but packs currently available for sale are worse than useless. They contain a great deal of cruft and filler (dinky band-aids, anti-itch cream) and they fail to include many things which are key in a real disaster (ex: duct tape, hemostatic bandages, fasteners, water purification and storage equipment). They also tend to skimp on quality, and a natural disaster is not the time to be relying on chintzy gear.


##THE SOLUTION
Ready-to-go custom made backpacks filled with the most useful equipment for disaster response (as chosen by medical professionals, first responders, and survivors) and *absolutely nothing else*. Stuff like quick-clotting gauze, waterproof matches, and signalling mirrors. With enough of each item that sharing is easy. And automatic emails that remind users to refresh their packs. No dinky band-aids.

##THE PLAN
The first run of packs will be crowdfunded by 1000 pre-orders and will be sold at-cost (around $100). We're aiming for a mid-February launch date. Subsequent runs will be sold normally at a low price-point, both to individual and institutional customers. Packs will also be available to purchase as donations, which will be distributed to those in need by our partner NGOs.
